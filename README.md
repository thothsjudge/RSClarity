# RSClarity
Free auto clicker – RSClarity

# Notice
Because RSClarity is a new, unsigned tool that simulates mouse input, Windows Defender, SmartScreen, or some antivirus/firewall products may flag it as suspicious.

If you downloaded RSClarity from the official link and you trust the file:

• UAC prompt — When Windows asks if you want to allow this app to make changes, click 'Yes' to enable global hotkeys and proper behavior.

• SmartScreen ('Windows protected your PC') — Click 'More info' → 'Run anyway' to start RSClarity.

• Antivirus / firewall blocks — You may need to allow RSClarity or add it as an exception. Only do this if you are sure you trust the source.

Never disable your security software globally just for RSClarity. Adjust only what you need, and only if you fully trust the executable.
